### üéØ 1. ComicCrate (Primary Project)

**Description**  
A virtual comic book shop and social community where users can browse, search, collect, and review comics. Comic fans can build personal libraries, rate issues, join discussions, and discover new titles through curated collections.

**Problem It Solves**  
There is no centralized social platform focused on comic book fans that combines collection management with community engagement. ComicCrate bridges that gap with social features and easy browsing.

**Data Source**  
- [ComicVine API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/) (free with registration) for comic book data: series, issues, characters, and publishers  
- Custom REST API (Express + MongoDB) for:
  - User profiles  
  - Personal collections  
  - Reviews & ratings  
  - Comments & discussions

### üí™ 2. FlexFeed

**Description**  
A social fitness platform where users can share workout routines, progress photos, tips, and gym recommendations. Think Instagram meets GymBro.

**Problem It Solves**  
Fitness communities are often scattered across generic platforms. FlexFeed provides a focused space for fitness enthusiasts to connect and share progress in a more motivating and relevant environment.

**Data Source**  
- Custom REST API for:
  - User profiles  
  - Posts (text + images)  
  - Likes & comments  
- Optional: Google Maps API integration for gym location and reviews

### üêæ 3. CatConnect

**Description**  
A fun and friendly social network for cat lovers to create profiles for their cats, share media, follow others, and join niche interest groups (rescue, breeds, memes, etc.).

**Problem It Solves**  
No platform currently centers cat content in a community-based, shareable, and searchable way. CatConnect offers a centralized hub for all things feline.

**Data Source**  
- Custom-built API for:
  - User & cat profiles  
  - Media posts  
  - Follower/following system  
  - Comments & group discussions  
- Optional: [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) for cat breeds, facts, and fun images
