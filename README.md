# capstone-comiccrate
Capstone project for USF/springboard bootcamp 

1. ComicCrate (Primary Project)
Description:
A virtual comic book shop and social community where users can browse, search, collect, and review comics. Comic fans can build personal libraries, rate issues, join discussions, and discover new titles through curated collections.

Problem It Solves:
There is no centralized social platform focused on comic book fans that combines collection management with community engagement. ComicCrate bridges that gap with social features and easy browsing.

Data Source:
Use the ComicVine API (free with registration) to fetch comic book data such as series, issues, characters, and publishers.
The app will also have its own API (built with Express and MongoDB) for users, collections, reviews, and comments.

2. FlexFeed
Description:
A social fitness platform for users to share workout routines, progress photos, tips, and gym recommendations. Think Instagram meets GymBro.

Problem It Solves:
Fitness communities are often fragmented across platforms. FlexFeed offers a dedicated space to share fitness progress and connect with like-minded lifters.

Data Source:
Custom API for users, posts, likes, and comments. Optional: integrate Google Maps API to find and review local gyms.

3. CatConnect
Description:
A light-hearted social network for cat lovers to create profiles for their cats, share photos and videos, follow other cat accounts, and join interest-based communities (like rescue groups, breeders, memes, etc.).

Problem It Solves:
Thereâ€™s no centralized platform where cat owners can share and discover feline-focused content or connect with niche cat communities.

Data Source:
Build your own API for users, posts, followers, comments, and groups. Optional: use TheCatAPI for cat breeds and fun facts.
